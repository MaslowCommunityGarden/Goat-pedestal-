# Goat pedestal 

A toy for my friend's mini goats, and a way to test a new fastener


This project was primarily a way to test a new fastener system which is using imbeded t nuts in the plywood to hold parts together. 

The big advantage of this system is that because the holes are predrilled and counter sunk as a part of the same operation as cutting the parts all of the inteligance is in the design. Assembly just involves tightening the parts together with a hex key.

I'm very impressed with how solid these are. Lets see how they stand up to being jumped on by goats.

A quick video about making the goat stand can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO-pAJZ6D5A&feature=youtu.be)

The download includes common 3D CAD models for the stand, a DXF of the parts ready to cut, and the original OnShape file is available [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/5338ed49b7253b03f40371e1/w/f915de939433c26bbe0f3e10/e/a97841d4c29578a0cdced65d)
