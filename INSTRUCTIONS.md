Assembly using t nuts is pretty simple. I found it easier to get the threads started with the nut rotated 90 degrees so that I could easily hold the nut between my fingers.

The only tool required is a hex key. 

I used blue wood stain to give the goat some color and applied it with a disposable foam brush. After the stain dried I sanded the front surface to remove any which got outside of the goat pocket.
